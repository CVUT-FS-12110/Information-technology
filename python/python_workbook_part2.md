# Python Workbook Part 2: Functions, Files, and OOP


üêç In this part, we‚Äôll move beyond the basics and learn how to make your code reusable, organized, and efficient.
You‚Äôll learn how to:

Write and use functions to avoid repeating code

Work with strings, files, and errors more effectively

Use modules and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) to structure larger programs

By the end of this guide, you‚Äôll be able to design small, functional Python projects with confidence ‚Äî and understand how professionals structure real programs.

## **1. Functions**

Functions are **blocks of reusable code** that perform a specific task.

They help make your programs easier to read, test, and maintain.

### Defining and Calling a Function

You define a function using a keyword `def`, followed by the function name and parentheses `()`.

```python
def greet():
    print("Hello, Python learner!")
```
To run the function, call it by name:

```python
greet()
```

Example output:
```
Hello, Python learner!
```
